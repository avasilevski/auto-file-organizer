üìÅ Auto File Organizer
Automatically sort files in your Downloads folder into categorized subfolders based on file type (e.g., PDFs, images, videos, etc.).

üß© File Organizer Workflow
	1.	main.py
	‚Ä¢	Starts the application and initializes a file watcher on the target directory (WORK_PATH)
	‚Ä¢	Uses WatcherHandler to bind the on_created event to a handler
	‚Ä¢	Keeps the process alive until interrupted (Ctrl+C)
	2.	watcher.py
	‚Ä¢	Implements Handler class that reacts to new file creation
	‚Ä¢	When triggered, it calls organize() from organizer.py
	3.	organizer.py
	‚Ä¢	organize() handles file classification and movement:
	‚Ä¢	Uses get_category() to classify based on extension
	‚Ä¢	Creates the destination folder under WORK_PATH
	‚Ä¢	Moves the file
	‚Ä¢	Calls log_move() from logger.py to record the action
	4.	logger.py
	‚Ä¢	Runs a C++ subprocess to log messages
	‚Ä¢	The C++ main.out:
	‚Ä¢	Creates the log directory (../logs)
	‚Ä¢	Appends timestamped logs to log.txt
